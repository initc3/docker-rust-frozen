This repository serves the purpose of having some nightly builds "from the past",
frozen in time. If you know of a better way to achieve this please let us know!

The images for the "frozen" nightly builds can be found on
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sbellem/rust).

This image has two types of tags, `<YYYY.MM.DD>` and `<YYYY.MM.DD>-slim`, which
match the nightly build corresponding to `<YYYY.MM.DD>`.

For the latest nightly and more information on rust nightly images see
https://github.com/rust-lang/docker-rust-nightly.
